# Usage Instructions

First, log in with Google!

Next, explore your boards:

* the **All** board will be a non-shareable and uneditable board with all of your TODO items across all of your boards
* **My Board** is your personal board
* You can create new boards at the **Create** button in the sidebar, and edit your boards by pressing the **pencil icon** next to each board's names
* Add any **users** you'd like to share your board with by clicking the share icon in the top right and typing in their emails

Then, create TODO items:

* Press the + icon in the top right to create a new TODO item! Each TODO item has the following optional fields:
  * a title,
  * a due date,
  * a priority (low, medium, high),
  * labels (e.g. CS 346),
  * assigned to (e.g. yourself, another user),
  * file attachment,
  * description
* After creating a TODO, you can edit by, pressing the pencil icon at the right of each TODO item
* You can filter, search and sort by different categories at the top left!

Finally, play around with the app!

* There are many keyboard shortcuts to make your life easier which you can find [here](https://gitlab.uwaterloo.ca/n7ismail/cs-346-project/-/wikis/Keyboard-Shortcuts)
* You can toggle light/dark themes by pressing the moon/sun icon in the sidebar and we'll save that preference for you when you logout!
